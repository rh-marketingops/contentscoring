# contentscoring (Content Scoring Model)
New business logic for maintaining marketing content score 

# Introduction
The Content Scoring Model was designed to provide insight and direction regarding content performance, creation and assessment.

The model was created to begin analyzing the performance of videos, blogs, and non-gated content.

The model was designed for insights: it is not absolute in its directives or results, as they are meant to summarize and highlight content that performs well (or poorly), and facilitate a deeper dive into the reasoning behind a specific content piecesâ€™ performance.
